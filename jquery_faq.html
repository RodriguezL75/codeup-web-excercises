    <dt>How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Only 118 of your 417 park sites charge entrance fees. You can obtain park entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have passes available; we recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes). Learn more about the America the Beautiful - The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass.</dd>

    <dt>Where can I find a park map?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">You can view maps on specific park websites or download maps from the Harpers Ferry Center map collection.</dd>

    <dt>How do I make reservations for camping/lodging in national parks?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">For campground reservations, visit Recreation.gov. Not all parks participate in this service; many campgrounds are first come, first served. For more information on specific camping and lodging services offered at the park(s) of your interest, please check specific park websites. You can also learn more about camping in national parks and find a map of parks with camping opportunities.</dd>

    <dt>How do I reserve a tour in a park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">You can book some park tours through Recreation.gov such as WWII Valor in the Pacific (Pearl Harbor), many Mammoth Cave National Park cave tours, Independence National Historical Park tours, and more. Not all parks participate in this reservation service. For more information on tours offered at a specific park, please see the park search.</dd>

    <dt>Can I bring my pet to a national park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Some national parks welcome pets—in developed areas, on many trails and campgrounds, and in some lodging facilities. Learn more about pets in parks.</dd>

    <dt>What do I need to know about driving off road in national parks?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Before you head out, check with the national parks that you intend to visit. In many national parks, off-road driving is illegal. Where off-road driving is allowed, the National Park Service regulates it.</dd>

    <dt>How do I apply for a job with the National Park Service?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">National Park Service jobs, including both permanent and seasonal positions, are listed on USAJOBs. Learn more about working for us, including opportunities for students and volunteers and tips for applying for jobs.</dd>

    <dt>What are concessions?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Concessionaires provide park visitors with lodging, transportation, food services, shops, and other services. More than 480 NPS concession contracts in more than 100 different park units vary in size from small, family-owned businesses to national/international corporations. Learn more about commercial services in the National Park Service.</dd>

    <dt>How do I find out about contracting opportunities?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Opportunities to contract with the National Park Service are posted to FedBizOpps.gov, the federal government’s electronic business portal.</dd>

    <dt>Where do I find out about grant and cooperative agreement programs and opportunities?</dt>
